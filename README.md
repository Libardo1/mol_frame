# MolFrames

Working with Pandas DataFrames that contain molecules.
![Example MolFrame](res/molframe.png)

The code is based on [RDKit](http://rdkit.org/), [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) and bluenote10's NimData [html browser](https://github.com/bluenote10/NimData/blob/master/src/nimdata/html.nim).
It was written and tested on Ubuntu 17.04 and Python 3.6.

See the accompanying Jupyter notebook for further examples.

Work in progress...
